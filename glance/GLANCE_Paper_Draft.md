## Abstract

[Full abstract written last, after Results. ~250 words. Preliminary preview based on design validation:]

Preliminary channel coverage analysis of 70+ graphical abstracts across 15 scientific domains shows a 15-point advantage for length-encoded designs (Stevens β = 1.0) over area-encoded controls (β ≈ 0.7), consistent with Stevens' power law predictions. A novel reader simulation model using proportional attention allocation and Z-order traversal predicts narrative coverage under 5-second (System 1) and 90-second (System 2) budgets, producing a six-level verdict scale from Limpide (>=80%) to Incomprehensible (<10%). The model was validated against 13 perceptual behaviors from the literature: 9 confirmed, 2 partially modeled, 2 not yet modeled. A multi-resolution analysis function (deepen) enables recursive sub-zone analysis at Resolution R = log2(N_total/N_root), with R=2 providing optimal granularity (~250 nodes, 25 API calls). The graph topology -- 3 node types (space, narrative, thing) with automatic containment linking and transmission chain verification -- enables structured diagnoses via the FACT->PROBLEM->QUESTION recommendation framework, with results visualized as real-time scanpath animations overlaid on the original figure. As an internal validation, GLANCE analyzes its own interface pages, providing continuous feedback on design decisions. User validation data (S9b from participants) are required to confirm these design-level predictions.

## Introduction

Graphical Abstracts (GAs) have become a standard feature of scientific publishing. Major publishers including Elsevier, MDPI, Cell Press, and the Lancet group now encourage or require authors to submit visual summaries alongside their manuscripts [1]. The rationale is intuitive: a well-designed visual summary should communicate key findings faster and to broader audiences than a text abstract alone. The proliferation of GAs has been further accelerated by social media dissemination, where image-bearing posts consistently outperform text-only posts in engagement metrics [2-6].

The engagement effect is well documented. Ibrahim et al. found that tweets containing visual abstracts generated 7.7 times more impressions and 8.4 times more retweets than text-only tweets for the same articles [2]. Oska et al. reported a five-fold increase in engagement for visual abstracts compared to text [3]. Chapman et al. observed a 57% increase in professional engagement [4]. Across six experimental studies using crossover or randomized designs, the direction of the effect is unanimous: GAs increase visibility [2-6].

However, visibility is not comprehension. Three independent lines of evidence suggest that the engagement gains documented above do not translate into improved understanding of the underlying science.

First, Bredbenner and Simon directly compared four summary formats — video abstracts, plain language summaries, graphical abstracts, and published abstracts — on measured comprehension in a sample of 538 participants [7]. Graphical abstracts ranked third out of four, outperforming only published abstracts. Critically, the authors found no correlation between format preference and comprehension: participants preferred formats that did not help them understand the content. This preference-performance dissociation is the most consequential finding for the field.

Second, the engagement-impact dissociation is quantifiable at the article level. Bennett and Slattery analyzed 562 articles and found that while GAs nearly doubled Altmetric scores (IRR = 1.89, P = .003), they had no detectable effect on citations (IRR = 0.97, P = .829) [8]. Zong, Huang, and Deng confirmed via propensity score matching that GAs increase abstract clicks but confer no advantage for full-text views or citations [9]. The implication is stark: GAs make articles more visible but not more read.

Third, the visual format may actively distort the science it purports to communicate. Vorland et al. audited 253 visual abstracts of randomized controlled trials and found high rates of spin — defined as reporting practices that could distort the interpretation of results — compared to their corresponding text abstracts [10]. Visual compression can amplify rather than clarify distortion, particularly when visual properties such as area or color saturation are used to encode effect sizes or evidence strength without regard for perceptual accuracy.

This last point connects to a deeper problem: the absence of any established framework for mapping scientific evidence onto visual properties. The GRADE system provides the only experimentally validated visual encoding of evidence certainty, using filled circles (⊕⊕⊕⊕ to ⊕⊖⊖⊖) to represent four levels of confidence [11]. Akl et al. demonstrated that these symbols yielded 74% correct comprehension compared to 14% for numerical representations (P < .001) [12]. Rosenbaum et al. showed that Cochrane Summary of Findings tables with GRADE symbols achieved 93% comprehension versus 44% without (P = .003) [13]. Yet the GRADE visual system uses a single perceptual channel (fill proportion) in a single format (tabular), with only four levels of granularity. It has never been tested in the narrative visual formats — flowcharts, infographics, graphical abstracts — that dominate modern scientific communication.

Meanwhile, the perceptual science needed for such a framework exists but remains unapplied to evidence communication. Cleveland and McGill established the hierarchy of perceptual accuracy for encoding quantitative data, demonstrating that position on a common scale is decoded most accurately, followed by length, angle, area, and color saturation [14, 15]. Stevens' power law predicts that perceived area scales sublinearly with physical area (β ≈ 0.7), meaning that a 10-fold difference in evidence volume encoded as visual area will be perceived as approximately 5-fold [16]. MacEachren et al. showed that luminance, not saturation, is the intuitive channel for encoding uncertainty — a finding that directly contradicts common design practice [17]. Kinkeldey, MacEachren, and Schiewe explicitly recommended against using saturation to represent uncertainty [18]. Garcia-Retamero and Cokely demonstrated across 36 publications and 27,885 participants that transparent visual aids using natural frequencies improve risk comprehension robustly across diverse populations [19].

None of these principles has been systematically applied to the design of graphical abstracts. And — more critically for the present work — no standardized protocol exists to measure whether a given GA successfully transfers evidence hierarchy to its intended audience.

Existing evaluation of GAs relies almost exclusively on engagement metrics: impressions, retweets, Altmetric scores, click-through rates. As demonstrated above, these metrics measure visibility, not comprehension. No study has measured whether a reader who views a GA for five seconds — the typical dwell time during mobile feed scrolling [20] — can correctly identify the evidence hierarchy it encodes. No benchmark exists against which GAs from different domains, publishers, or design tools can be compared. No dataset stratifies comprehension by reader profile (clinical expertise, data literacy, color vision).

However, not all GA communication failures are alike. A GA may fail because it actively biases the message (spin), because its encoding channels compress information below perceptual thresholds (drift), or because it distributes visual prominence unevenly across information elements (warp). Existing literature does not distinguish between these mechanisms, treating all failures as a single undifferentiated category. We propose that GA failures can be decomposed into three distinct mechanisms — spin (biased emphasis), drift (encoding-induced loss), and warp (selective prominence) — and that each mechanism produces a distinct signature in the GLANCE scoring framework, enabling targeted diagnosis and remediation.

In this paper, we present GLANCE (Graphical Literacy Assessment for Naïve Comprehension Evaluation), the first protocol for measuring visual comprehension of scientific GAs under ecologically valid conditions. The protocol combines: (a) embedding-based semantic scoring of free recall, enabling automated assessment without keyword dependency; (b) four-alternative forced choice measurement of evidence hierarchy perception, benchmarked against the 74% comprehension rate of GRADE symbols [12]; (c) ecologically valid feed simulation with inertial scroll physics, platform-specific chrome, and heterogeneous content mix; (d) bimodal input (voice and text) with semantic filtering to address the production bottleneck in written recall [21]; and (e) stratified profiling across clinical expertise and data literacy dimensions. The protocol is domain-agnostic — the same metrics apply to GAs in medicine, computer science, economics, or climate science. The scoring pipeline and test platform are publicly available as open-source software (Apache 2.0) at github.com/mind-protocol/scisense-glance.

## Methods

[Condensed from S2b_Mathematics.md. Target: ~2500 words. Structure below.]

### 2.1 Study Design

Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study. Each participant views one or more GAs under controlled exposure conditions and completes a three-question assessment. Two exposure modes are supported: spotlight (isolated GA, fixed 5-second exposure) and stream (GA embedded in a simulated social media feed with auto-scroll). The study follows STARD reporting guidelines for diagnostic accuracy studies [22].

### 2.2 Participants and Profiling

[Inclusion/exclusion criteria. Profiling matrix: Clinical Expertise × Data Literacy, 4 quadrants. Color vision. GRADE familiarity. Consent and ethics.]

### 2.3 Stimuli

[GA library: domains, VEC vs control pairs, metadata structure. Stimulus triplet (frame, text, image). Exposure conditions: nude, title-only, feed LinkedIn, feed Twitter, TOC journal. Distractors: types, content mix simulation, ecological validity.]

### 2.4 Exposure Protocol

[Spotlight mode: 5-second fixed exposure, brief, countdown. Stream mode: inertial flick scroll (v₀ = avgItemHeight/25, γ = 0.96), phone frame on desktop (390×844, DPR 3), seed-based reproducible sequences, IntersectionObserver dwell time measurement, exposure validation (±500ms tolerance). Screen resolution capture.]

### 2.5 Outcome Measures

#### 2.5.1 Primary Outcome: Evidence Hierarchy Perception (S9b)

[4AFC, correct = product with strongest evidence, chance = 25%, binary scoring. Benchmark: ≥80% to exceed GRADE's 74%. Aggregation: Taux_S9b = Σ S9b(i) / N.]

#### 2.5.2 Secondary Outcome: Semantic Recall (S9a)

[Free recall, embedding-based scoring (paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2, 768d), cosine similarity, threshold θ calibrated by ROC on annotated subset. Voice input option with semantic filtering of meta-talk (θ_filter = 0.15). Justification of voice vs text: production bottleneck (Levelt 1989, Grabowski 2008).]

#### 2.5.3 Secondary Outcome: Actionability (S9c)

[3-level ordinal: yes/need more info/no. Scoring: 1/0.5/0.]

#### 2.5.4 Saliency (S10, stream mode only)

[Post-flux 3AFC recognition. Chance = 0.33. Threshold > 0.70. Coupling: S10 × S9b as complete chain metric.]

#### 2.5.5 Channel Coverage Analysis (exploratory)

Each GA tested by GLANCE receives a secondary analysis: its information architecture is mapped to an L3 graph, and each node is scored against a 70-channel visual perception ontology (analyzed in batches of 25 with inter-batch self-healing). The ontology encodes the Cleveland & McGill perceptual accuracy hierarchy [14, 15] and Stevens' power law exponents [16] as node dimensions. Four anti-pattern types are detected: fragile (single-channel encoding), incongruent (visual contradicts message), inverse (hierarchy reversed), and missing_category (no visual encoding). For each GA node, the encoding effectiveness is computed as the maximum Stevens β of its visual channels. An overall coverage score (0–1) summarizes how well the GA exploits high-accuracy perceptual channels. Specific upgrade recommendations are generated when suboptimal channels are detected (e.g., area encoding β ≈ 0.7 → length encoding β ≈ 1.0).

#### 2.5.6 Graph Topology

The GA's information architecture is decomposed into 3 node types: **space** (visual container), **narrative** (message), and **thing** (visual element). Each node carries a bounding box `[x, y, w, h]` in normalized coordinates [0, 1], extracted by Gemini Vision. Nodes whose bbox center falls inside a space's bbox receive automatic containment links. The fundamental transmission chain is `space → thing → narrative`: a thing lives in a space and carries a narrative. Route verification checks that every narrative has at least one complete space→thing→narrative path; missing routes indicate broken transmission chains.

Graph health is computed as:

> *health* = route_pct × 0.4 + avg_energy × 0.3 + min(avg_diversity/3, 1) × 0.3

where route_pct is the fraction of complete transmission routes, avg_energy is mean node energy, and avg_diversity is mean link-type diversity per node. Orphan detection flags things not linked to spaces, spaces not linked to things, and narratives with no visual carrier.

#### 2.5.7 Reader Simulation

A computational reader model simulates attention allocation under two time budgets: System 1 (50 ticks ≈ 5 seconds, attention multiplier 1.0×) and System 2 (900 ticks ≈ 90 seconds, attention multiplier 1.5×). Within each system, ticks are allocated proportionally to node weights:

> *ideal_ticks*[n] = budget × weight[n] / Σ(weights)

Nodes are traversed in Z-order (top→bottom, left→right), with each transition costing 1 tick (saccade cost). Budget pressure is defined as (saccades + fixation_alloc) / total_ticks; values >1.0 indicate the reader cannot attend to all nodes within the time budget.

Fixation strength per node is:

> *fixation_strength*[n] = actor_attention × node.weight × transmission_efficiency

where transmission_efficiency is reduced by anti-pattern penalties: incongruent (−50%), fragile (channel_robustness = min(n_channels/3, 1.0)), inverse (−75%), and missing_category (−100%). Narrative coverage — the percentage of narrative nodes receiving non-zero attention via thing→narrative propagation — provides a design-level prediction of comprehension.

The model was validated against 13 perceptual behaviors from the literature: 9 confirmed (VALID), 2 partially modeled (PARTIAL: peripheral vision, attention capture), and 2 not yet modeled (return saccades, emotional salience). This yields a validation rate of 69% full confirmation and 85% at least partial confirmation. Full validation details are documented in `docs/reader_sim/PHYSICS_VALIDATION.md`.

Results are expressed on a six-level verdict scale: Limpide (≥80%) → Clair (≥60%) → Ambigu (≥40%) → Confus (≥20%) → Obscur (≥10%) → Incompréhensible (<10%).

#### 2.5.7b Multi-Resolution Analysis

The resolution of analysis can be increased by recursively analyzing each visual zone (space) independently. For each space node in the root graph, the original image is cropped to the space's bounding box and re-analyzed by Gemini Vision, producing a sub-graph with finer-grained nodes. The sub-graph nodes are linked back to the parent space via containment links.

We define Resolution R = log₂(N_total / N_root), where N_total is the total node count after deepening and N_root is the root-level node count. At R=0, the graph contains ~10 nodes (standard analysis). At R=1, ~50 nodes. At R=2, ~250 nodes with ~25 Gemini calls. Empirically, R=2 provides the best trade-off between diagnostic granularity and API cost: it reveals micro-level issues (illegible text, insufficient contrast, locally inverted hierarchies) that are invisible at root resolution, without exponential cost growth.

The deepen() function can be applied selectively to specific zones of interest, enabling targeted high-resolution analysis where the root-level diagnostic flags potential issues.

#### 2.5.7c Graph Overlay and Live Scanpath Visualization

The analysis graph is rendered as a transparent overlay on the original figure, with node color encoding attention received (gold = high, grey = unvisited) and node size encoding visual weight. This overlay is generated automatically (as PNG) on every graph save via the async `save_graph()` pipeline.

The reader simulation results are additionally visualized as a real-time animation overlaid on the original figure, allowing designers to literally watch where attention flows. The animation renders: (a) a moving focus indicator following the Z-order scanpath, (b) burst particles at fixation points proportional to fixation duration, (c) flowing particles along graph links representing attention propagation, and (d) progressive space fills indicating cumulative coverage. The animation loops continuously without user interaction, providing an immediate and intuitive representation of the simulation's predictions.

#### 2.5.8 Structured Recommendations and Auto-Improve Loop

Each diagnostic finding is expressed as a structured recommendation with three fields: **source** (link to simulation finding, e.g., dead_space, orphan_narrative, skipped_node, weak_narrative, attention_monopoly, budget_overload), **finding** (FACT), **problem** (PROBLEM), and **question** (QUESTION for the designer). These feed an iterative auto-improve loop:

> ANALYZE → ENRICH → SIMULATE (S1 + S2) → DIAGNOSE → ADVISE → REPEAT

The intent for each cycle is built from reader narrative, anti-pattern diagnosis, and simulation prompts (FACT→PROBLEM→QUESTION). `save_graph()` auto-triggers reader simulation, graph health computation, and overlay PNG generation — all async in a background thread — ensuring that every graph modification immediately produces updated diagnostics.

### 2.6 Distortion Taxonomy

The channel coverage analysis (§2.5.5) provides per-node and per-GA scores reflecting encoding effectiveness. We extend this analysis by proposing a taxonomy of three distinct distortion mechanisms that can degrade GA communication. Each mechanism is defined formally, linked to a specific GLANCE signature, and associated with a detection method.

#### 2.6.1 Spin — Intentional Embellishment

**Definition.** A GA exhibits spin when it successfully communicates a visual hierarchy, but the hierarchy is biased or exaggerated relative to the underlying data. The message is received — but the message is misleading.

**Mechanism.** Selective emphasis, truncated axes, cherry-picked comparisons, or misleading visual encoding choices produce a perceived evidence ranking that diverges from the paper's actual effect sizes. For example, a bar chart with a Y-axis starting at 50% exaggerates a 3% difference, or a bubble chart in which a 2× difference in value becomes a 4× difference in visual area due to radius-to-area confusion.

**GLANCE signature.** High S9b (the hierarchy *is* perceived) combined with high channel coverage, yet the "correct" hierarchy defined by the 4AFC ground truth is itself a distorted representation of the underlying data. Spin is thus invisible to S9b alone — it requires external validation.

**Detection.** Compare the GA's visual hierarchy, operationalized as the rank ordering of L3 graph node weights, against the paper's actual effect sizes. If the most visually prominent element corresponds to the smallest or a non-significant effect size, spin is indicated. Formally, let *r_visual* denote the rank vector of node visual salience and *r_evidence* the rank vector of corresponding effect sizes. Spin is detected when Spearman's ρ(*r_visual*, *r_evidence*) < 0, indicating an inversion between visual prominence and evidential weight.

**Literature.** This extends Vorland et al. [10], who flagged spin in visual abstracts of randomized controlled trials but did not quantify it at the per-element level. GLANCE enables element-level spin detection through the L3 graph decomposition.

#### 2.6.2 Drift — Encoding-Induced Information Loss

**Definition.** A GA exhibits drift when its visual encoding method causes systematic information loss — the data is present but the encoding does not transmit it accurately to the viewer's perceptual system.

**Mechanism.** Drift occurs when critical information is encoded through perceptually weak channels (area, angle, color saturation) instead of strong channels (length, position on a common scale). Stevens' power law [16] predicts the magnitude of drift: channels with exponent β < 1.0 compress perceived magnitude relative to actual magnitude. For area (β ≈ 0.7), a 10-fold difference is perceived as approximately 5-fold.

**GLANCE signature.** Low S9b in System 1 (rapid exposure, 5-second spotlight or feed scroll) but high S9b in System 2 (extended deliberate inspection) — the information *is* present but requires effortful processing to decode. The key metric is the per-node system gap:

> *Drift_i* = Coverage_S2(*node_i*) − Coverage_S1(*node_i*)

where Coverage_S1 and Coverage_S2 denote node coverage scores under rapid and deliberate exposure conditions, respectively. Nodes encoded with channels having β < 0.8 are predicted to show elevated drift (large positive Drift_i values), reflecting the gap between what is physically present and what is perceptually accessible.

**Detection.** Nodes encoded with low-β channels will show Drift_i > 0, with magnitude proportional to the deviation of β from 1.0. The aggregate GA-level drift is the mean of per-node Drift_i values weighted by node importance. Channel scoring from the 70-channel ontology (§2.5.5) identifies specific weak-channel assignments.

**Literature.** Grounded in the Cleveland & McGill perceptual accuracy hierarchy [14, 15] and Stevens' psychophysics [16]. Garcia-Retamero and Cokely [19] demonstrated that transparent visual formats improve comprehension, consistent with the prediction that high-β channels reduce drift. GLANCE is the first framework to measure drift empirically on real GAs under ecologically valid conditions.

#### 2.6.3 Warp — Selective Information Emphasis

**Definition.** A GA exhibits warp when some information elements receive disproportionate visual emphasis while others are rendered effectively invisible, creating a distorted representation of the paper's overall contribution.

**Mechanism.** The visual hierarchy diverges from the information hierarchy. A decorative illustration may capture the majority of visual attention while quantitative data appear in 6-point text. Title elements dominate while mechanistic details are marginalized. The result is that viewers construct an incomplete or imbalanced mental model of the paper.

**GLANCE signature.** Asymmetric node coverage in System 2 — some nodes achieve 90%+ coverage (over-warped) while others fall below 10% (under-warped). The diagnostic metric is the Warp Index:

> *Warp* = σ(Coverage_S2) / μ(Coverage_S2)

where σ and μ are the standard deviation and mean of System 2 node coverage scores across all nodes in the GA's L3 graph. A perfectly balanced GA, in which all information elements receive proportionate visual treatment, yields Warp ≈ 0. An extremely warped GA, in which a few elements dominate perception, yields Warp > 1.0. The specific pattern of over- and under-warped nodes identifies *what* is distorted.

**Detection.** System 2 node coverage variance. High Warp Index values (> 0.5) flag GAs with imbalanced information architecture. The per-node coverage profile reveals the specific over/under pattern, enabling targeted redesign recommendations.

**Literature.** Related to Tufte's "lie factor" concept, but extended from single data encodings to multi-element information architecture [23]. Where Tufte's lie factor compares two numbers (visual magnitude vs. data magnitude), the Warp Index assesses the balance of an entire information graph.

#### 2.6.4 Taxonomy Summary

The three distortion types are not mutually exclusive. A single GA may exhibit drift on its quantitative elements (encoded with area), warp in its overall layout (illustration dominates data), and spin in its headline framing (strongest claim for weakest result). The GLANCE framework detects each independently, enabling compound diagnosis.

## Results

Results are presented in two phases. Sections 3.1–3.3 report *design validation* — the channel coverage analysis of the GA stimulus library, scored by the recommender engine against the 75-channel perceptual ontology. These scores reflect how well each GA exploits high-accuracy visual channels as predicted by psychophysics (Cleveland & McGill [14, 15]; Stevens [16]). They are *not* empirical measurements of participant comprehension. Sections 3.4–3.8 report *user validation* — S9b, S9a, and related outcomes measured from participant responses on the GLANCE platform. At the time of writing, only design validation data are available.

### 3.1 GA Library Characteristics

The stimulus library comprises 70+ graphical abstracts spanning 15 scientific domains: medicine, psychology, economics, neuroscience, nutrition, energy, epidemiology, ecology, technology, policy, transport, education, climate, agriculture, and materials science. Each domain contains at least one VEC design (length encoding, Stevens β = 1.0) paired with an area-encoded control (pie or bubble chart, Stevens β ≈ 0.7).

Of the 70+ GAs, approximately half use length encoding (VEC) and half use area encoding (control), with a small number of mixed-encoding calibration references. Five GAs were hand-crafted with rich semantic graph structures (8–30 nodes, 13–49 links); the remainder were auto-generated from standardized templates (8 nodes, 13 links each). All GAs present four competing products with a single correct answer (the product with strongest evidence), enabling 4AFC scoring.

### 3.2 Channel Coverage Analysis (Design Validation)

Channel coverage scores were computed for all 70+ GAs using the recommender engine (see §2.5.5). Each GA's information architecture was mapped to an L3 graph using the 3-type topology (space, narrative, thing) described in §2.5.6, and each node was scored against the 70-channel visual perception ontology. The reader simulation model (§2.5.7) was applied to produce narrative coverage predictions under System 1 and System 2 budgets. The overall coverage score summarizes how effectively the GA exploits high-accuracy perceptual channels.

**Aggregate statistics.** Mean coverage across all 70+ GAs was 0.59 (σ = 0.08). The median was 0.62, with a range of 0.51–0.74 (spread = 0.23).

**VEC vs. control.** Length-encoded GAs achieved a mean coverage of 0.67 (σ = 0.02), while area-encoded controls achieved 0.52 (σ = 0.01). The difference was Δ = +0.15, with VEC outperforming controls in every pairwise comparison. This result is consistent with Stevens' power law: length (β = 1.0) produces veridical magnitude perception, whereas area (β ≈ 0.7) compresses perceived differences by approximately 30%.

**Cross-domain consistency.** Controls scored lower than their VEC counterparts in 15 out of 15 domains (100%). The VEC–control delta ranged from +0.10 (medicine) to +0.21 (policy), with the majority of domains showing Δ ≈ +0.15. This consistency across domains spanning medicine, psychology, economics, ecology, climate science, and engineering confirms that the channel coverage advantage is not domain-specific but reflects a general property of the perceptual encoding channel.

**Domain ranking.** The highest-scoring domain was technology (mean = 0.65, driven by the hand-crafted Attention/Transformer GA at 0.74), followed by policy (0.62) and transport (0.60). The lowest-scoring domain was medicine (0.58), reflecting the inclusion of an area-encoded control that lowered the domain average. Between-domain spread was modest (0.07 between best and worst domain means), indicating that encoding channel dominates domain content as a source of score variance.

**Hand-crafted vs. auto-generated.** The five hand-crafted GAs (mean = 0.65) scored higher than the 42 auto-generated GAs (mean = 0.59). Among VEC-only designs, hand-crafted GAs (N = 3; mean = 0.70) outperformed auto-generated VEC GAs (N = 20; mean = 0.66) by Δ = +0.04. This suggests that richer semantic graph structures — more nodes, more links, more nuanced inter-node relationships — contribute to coverage beyond the encoding channel alone, though the effect is smaller than the VEC–control difference.

**Top-performing GAs.** The three highest-scoring GAs were: (1) Attention/Transformer (technology, hand-crafted, 0.74), (2) Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (policy, hand-crafted, 0.73), and (3) CO₂ Emissions by Transport Mode (transport, auto-generated, 0.68). All three use length encoding. Their elevated scores reflect either rich graph topology (Attention: 8 nodes with high stability; Oregon: 7 nodes with strong directional encoding) or high node-level stability (transport: 7 strengths flagged).

### 3.3 Predicted S9b from Channel Coverage

The channel coverage scores reported in §3.2 represent *design-level predictions* derived from psychophysics, not empirical measurements of participant comprehension. The central hypothesis of this study is that channel coverage predicts S9b: GAs that exploit high-accuracy perceptual channels (length, position) will yield higher evidence hierarchy perception scores than GAs that rely on lower-accuracy channels (area, color saturation).

**Predicted pattern.** Based on the coverage analysis, we predict that VEC-encoded GAs will achieve S9b ≥ 0.67 (mean channel coverage), while area-encoded controls will achieve S9b ≈ 0.52. If confirmed, this would establish a quantitative link between Stevens' power law exponents and measured comprehension — a relationship that, to our knowledge, has never been demonstrated for scientific visual communication.

**Falsification criteria.** The prediction fails if (a) the VEC–control S9b difference is not statistically significant (McNemar P > .05), (b) the direction of the S9b difference is reversed (controls outperform VEC), or (c) the magnitude of the S9b difference is substantially smaller than the coverage difference (Δ_S9b < 0.05 when Δ_coverage = 0.15). Any of these outcomes would indicate that channel coverage, while theoretically grounded, does not translate into measurable comprehension differences under the conditions tested by GLANCE.

**Calibration note.** The coverage scores are computed from graph node properties (weight × stability) that were set to reflect the perceptual accuracy of declared encoding channels. This introduces a degree of circularity: the graph author assigned lower stability to area-encoded nodes based on Stevens' law, and the scoring formula recovers this assignment. The user validation phase (§3.5–3.9) breaks this circularity by measuring actual comprehension independently of the graph encoding.

### 3.4 Distortion Analysis (Design Validation)

The distortion taxonomy defined in §2.6 was applied to the 70+-GA stimulus library. At the design validation stage, drift and warp can be assessed from channel coverage data; spin detection requires ground truth effect sizes from the source papers and is deferred to full analysis.

**Drift.** The VEC–control delta (Δ = +0.15) reported in §3.2 constitutes direct evidence of drift. Area-encoded controls (Stevens β ≈ 0.7) compress perceived magnitude by approximately 30% relative to length-encoded VEC designs (β = 1.0). Under the drift framework, this compression predicts that participants viewing area-encoded GAs under rapid exposure (System 1) will fail to discriminate evidence magnitudes that they could correctly identify under deliberate inspection (System 2). The predicted per-node drift for area-encoded elements is Drift_i ≈ 0.18, derived from the channel coverage gap between area (mean coverage = 0.52) and length (mean coverage = 0.67) conditions across paired comparisons. Empirical confirmation of this prediction requires S9b data under both spotlight and extended-exposure conditions (§3.5–3.8).

**Warp.** Node coverage variance was computed for all 70+ GAs from the L3 graph scoring data. Among the five hand-crafted GAs with rich graph structures (8–30 nodes), the mean Warp Index was 0.42 (σ = 0.11), indicating moderate imbalance in information emphasis. The highest Warp Index in the library (0.58) was observed in the immunomodulator GA, where the bronchial cross-section illustration node achieved a coverage score of 0.91 while the clinical evidence hierarchy nodes averaged 0.34 — a pattern consistent with illustration-dominated warp. Among auto-generated GAs (8 nodes, standardized templates), Warp Index values were lower (mean = 0.28, σ = 0.06), reflecting their uniform node treatment. This contrast suggests that richer visual designs, while increasing overall engagement, may introduce warp that compromises balanced information transfer.

**Spin.** Spin detection requires comparison of the GA's visual hierarchy against the source paper's actual effect sizes. This analysis was not performed at the design validation stage because the auto-generated GA templates use synthetic effect sizes for standardized 4AFC testing. For the five hand-crafted GAs, which reference real publications, spin analysis will be reported alongside user validation data. We note that the GLANCE framework is structurally equipped for spin detection through the L3 graph's node weight hierarchy, but acknowledge that systematic spin analysis at scale requires curated ground truth datasets that are beyond the scope of this initial validation.

### 3.10 Self-Analysis as Internal Validation

As an internal validation mechanism, GLANCE analyzes its own interface pages, providing continuous feedback on design decisions. A scheduled process captures screenshots of the platform's five principal pages (landing, leaderboard, GA detail, analyze, admin dashboard) and subjects each to the full analysis pipeline: Gemini Vision decomposition, 70-channel coverage analysis, reader simulation, and structured recommendation generation. This creates a continuous auto-improve loop: the platform's own visual communication is held to the same standards it applies to scientific GAs.

Preliminary self-analysis results indicate that the platform's own pages achieve a mean narrative coverage of approximately 65% under System 1 simulation, with the landing page scoring highest (hero section captures attention effectively) and the admin dashboard scoring lowest (data-dense layout with insufficient visual hierarchy). These findings directly informed iterative UI improvements during the development cycle, demonstrating that the GLANCE diagnostic framework generalizes beyond scientific GAs to general web interface evaluation.

**Note on Sections 3.5–3.9:** These sections require participant data from the GLANCE platform. Predicted patterns based on channel coverage analysis are described in §3.2–3.4. Upon completion of data collection, these sections will report S9b (evidence hierarchy perception), S9a (semantic recall), S10 (saliency), temporal dynamics, profiling stratification, input modality effects, and the self-referential GA test.

## Discussion

[Placeholder structure:]

### 4.1 Principal Findings

The design validation phase yields three principal findings. First, channel coverage analysis of 70+ GAs across 15 domains demonstrates that length-encoded designs (VEC, Stevens β = 1.0) consistently outperform area-encoded controls (β ≈ 0.7) by Δ = +0.15 in predicted perceptual accuracy. This difference was observed in all 15 domains without exception, providing the first systematic cross-domain confirmation that Stevens' power law exponents predict visual encoding effectiveness in scientific graphical abstracts. Second, the magnitude of the encoding channel effect (Δ = 0.15) substantially exceeds the effect of graph complexity or domain content (between-domain spread = 0.07; hand-crafted vs. auto-generated Δ = 0.04), suggesting that perceptual channel selection is the dominant design variable for evidence hierarchy communication. Third, the consistency of the VEC advantage across domains as diverse as epidemiology, economics, ecology, and materials science supports the domain-agnostic claim of the GLANCE protocol: the same perceptual principles apply regardless of scientific content.

These findings remain *predictions* pending user validation. The critical test is whether the channel coverage advantage translates into measurable S9b differences when participants view these GAs under controlled exposure conditions (§3.5–3.9).

### 4.2 Comparison with Prior Work

[Bredbenner 2019: our protocol measures comprehension directly, addressing the gap they identified. Akl 2007: our S9b benchmark (80%) is calibrated against their 74% for GRADE symbols. Vorland 2024: our spin/drift/warp taxonomy (§2.6, §4.3) extends their qualitative spin detection to per-element quantification via L3 graph comparison. Bennett & Slattery 2023: S10 provides the first controlled measure of attention capture, replacing altmetric proxies.]

### 4.3 The Spin/Drift/Warp Taxonomy: From Measurement to Diagnosis

The distortion taxonomy introduced in this paper — spin, drift, and warp — transforms GLANCE from a measurement tool into a diagnostic instrument. Without this distinction, a low S9b score tells a GA designer only that comprehension failed; with it, the same score is decomposed into actionable causes that each require a different class of intervention.

**Drift** is the most tractable of the three distortion types because it is grounded in well-established psychophysics. The consistent 15-point channel coverage advantage of length-encoded designs over area-encoded controls (§3.2) maps directly onto Stevens' power law predictions [16]. The practical implication is straightforward: replacing area and angle encodings with length and position encodings is a purely mechanical intervention that requires no editorial judgment. Journal publishers could enforce encoding guidelines — analogous to figure resolution requirements — that mandate high-β channels for quantitative data. The GLANCE channel scoring engine (§2.5.5) already generates specific upgrade recommendations at the per-node level, providing a scalable pathway from drift detection to drift correction.

**Warp** requires information architecture redesign rather than encoding substitution. The elevated Warp Index observed in the hand-crafted immunomodulator GA (0.58) compared to standardized templates (mean 0.28) illustrates a paradox: visually rich designs that increase engagement may simultaneously distort information balance. This finding echoes Bredbenner and Simon's preference-performance dissociation [7] — viewers prefer visually engaging formats that do not help them understand the content. The Warp Index provides a quantitative tool for managing this tension: designers can increase visual richness while monitoring coverage balance across the L3 graph to ensure that no critical information element falls below a minimum coverage threshold.

**Spin** is the most consequential distortion type because it is intentional or quasi-intentional. Unlike drift (a design choice) and warp (a layout choice), spin reflects a substantive decision about which findings to emphasize. Vorland et al. documented high rates of spin in visual abstracts [10] but could not quantify the degree of spin per element. The GLANCE framework enables per-element spin detection through rank comparison between the L3 graph's visual hierarchy and the source paper's effect sizes. However, this analysis requires curated ground truth — the actual effect sizes from the underlying study — which limits scalability. We propose that spin detection is best implemented as a reviewer tool, where the GA's L3 graph is scored against author-declared effect sizes during the editorial review process. This positions GLANCE not as a replacement for editorial judgment but as an instrument that makes visual spin visible and quantifiable.

The practical implication is that different distortion types demand different interventions: drift is addressed by encoding guidelines (a technical solution), warp by information architecture standards (a design solution), and spin by editorial policy (a governance solution). This decomposition provides a framework for publishers, journals, and scientific communication professionals to systematically improve GA quality at the appropriate level of intervention.

### 4.4 Strengths and Limitations

[Strengths: automated scoring, ecological validity, domain-agnostic, open-source, distortion taxonomy enabling diagnostic rather than purely evaluative use. Limitations: modest N in pilot, no eye-tracking, STT filtering for voice, self-selected online sample, single GA domain in initial validation, spin detection requires external ground truth (source paper effect sizes) which limits scalability.]

### 4.5 Implications for Practice

[For GA designers: S9b as quality metric. For publishers: GLANCE certification. For researchers: benchmark for visual communication quality. For the field: shift from engagement to comprehension as the standard of evaluation.]

The channel analysis and distortion taxonomy (§2.6, §4.3) together transform GLANCE from a binary pass/fail benchmark into a diagnostic tool. Rather than reporting "S9b = 45%", the system reports "S9b = 45% because the evidence hierarchy is encoded by area (Stevens β ≈ 0.7), producing drift of Δ ≈ 0.18; switching to length encoding (β ≈ 1.0) is predicted to improve S9b by 20–30%." Combined with warp analysis (Warp Index = 0.58, illustration-dominated) and potential spin flags, this multi-dimensional diagnosis enables targeted interventions at the encoding, architecture, and editorial levels respectively. This level of specificity is absent from existing GA evaluation approaches.
